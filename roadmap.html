    <h1> First Year Roadmap</h1>
    <p>Here’s your step-by-step guide to surviving — and thriving — in your first year of IT and Computer Science at a TVET college.</p>

    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 1: Orientation & Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: You’re new to campus, meeting lecturers and classmates, and learning how the system works.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Attend orientation — get a map, know where your classes are.</li>
            <li>Ask how to use student email, the library, and Moodle/NSFAS platforms.</li>
            <li>Create a file/folder for each subject — go digital and physical.</li>
            <li>Set your intention: why are you here? Write it down.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 2–3: Academic Groundwork</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: The real learning begins. You’ll start getting assignments and weekly lectures will intensify.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Make a weekly study timetable (realistic, not perfect).</li>
            <li>Watch YouTube tutorials for extra help in programming/math.</li>
            <li>Revise after class. 20 minutes daily beats 4 hours last-minute.</li>
            <li>Get to know your subject facilitators. Ask questions after class.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 4: Self-Check & Mid-Term Focus</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: Tests are coming. You’re probably tired or overwhelmed. This is where most students either adjust or fall behind.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Ask yourself: “What subjects am I struggling with?” Then fix them.</li>
            <li>Join or create a study group — even 3 people helps.</li>
            <li>Speak to your mentor or a second-year for advice.</li>
            <li>Download past test papers from the portal or ask your lecturer.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 5–6: Apply & Practice</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: You now know how things work. It’s time to build confidence through repetition and practice.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Build something small: a website (HTML), a calculator (JavaScript), etc.</li>
            <li>Use apps like Notion or Google Docs for notes and flashcards.</li>
            <li>Do projects in Programming and Mechatronics with purpose.</li>
            <li>Ask lecturers for one-on-one time if you’re lost. They’ll appreciate the effort.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 7: Exam Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: Final exam pressure kicks in. The work gets serious. But don’t panic — you’re not alone.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Break study time into 1-hour sessions with 10-minute breaks.</li>
            <li>Print summaries for Math formulas, Robotics concepts, code snippets.</li>
            <li>Use past papers daily — test yourself like it’s the real exam.</li>
            <li>Avoid “studying noise” — clean your space, put your phone away.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 8: Reflection & Recharge</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: Exams are over. Now it’s time to reflect and reset. This month is just as important as all the rest.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>List what you did well — celebrate even small wins.</li>
            <li>Write down mistakes and what you’ll improve next semester.</li>
            <li>Take a break — go outside, spend time offline, laugh.</li>
            <li>Keep your notes organized. Don’t lose the work you’ve done.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2> Month 9–12: The Level-Up</h2>
        <p>
          > What’s happening: You’re entering semester two. You’re no longer a beginner. This is your chance to level up everything.<br><br>
           Tips:
          <ul>
            <li>Start building a portfolio: a personal website, a blog, a mini project.</li>
            <li>Help a friend — explaining topics to others will make you smarter.</li>
            <li>Try GitHub or Figma or Python — explore beyond the classroom.</li>
            <li>Think of the future: where do you want to be in 2 years?</li>
          </ul>
